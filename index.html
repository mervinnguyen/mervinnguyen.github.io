                            <p>There are, in my opinion, two types of people: those who seek careers that complement their innate abilities and those who take on challenging careers that they are enthusiastic about an put in a lot of work to succeed in them. Given that I had to overcome several obstacles to get to where I am now, I can relate to the latter. I love to solve a puzzling question with the most optimized solution.</p>

                            <p>I recall learning java in my first programming class in high school with a sense of doubt, wondering if I belonged there. Despite facing numerous late-night projects and underperforming on many of them relative to my standards, I refused to be discouraged. I was determined not to let my acceptance into this major go to waste. The satisfaction of resolving those elusive segmentation faults, often after hours of effort, fueled my persistence. This resilience has paid off, as I will be graduating from the University of California, Irvine with a B.S. in Computer Engineering ahead of expectance. My primary focus has been on Embedded Systems development, which involves an in-depth exploration of Device Driver implementation.</p>

                            <p>After completing my first internship and a relatively long job search (5 months), I landed a position at Innova Electronics Corporation as an Embedded System Engineer Intern. I currently work on the 5610 OBD2 Scan Tool project writing software that is related to eMMC (embedded MultiMediaCard) performance optimization. How does the host device communicate with the data transmitted from the vehicle? How fast is the data being transmitted to the microprocessor? What if the processor just resets randomly? With a team of experts, we help answer and execute these challenging questions.</p>

                            <p>I am in the early stages of my career, bringing with it a strong motivation and passion for learning new technologies. I am currently focused on entering the Embedded Systems domain, dedicating myself to personal projects and deepening my understanding of core components such as the Kernel and Bootloader.</p>

I believed that engineering a project based on a sport I had competitively engaged in for years would be a particularly rewarding endeavor. The game features a randomly generated map and ball's speed increases as the game advances. The code continuously monitors input from the push button to adjust the paddle's position. This project has been one of the most intriguing and fulfilling passion projects I have undertaken.</p>

The project employs a client-server software architecture using the TCP/IP communication protocol via sockets, enabling seamless multiplayer functionality. It incorporates multithreading to ensure efficient and concurrent gameplay. Extensive use of git for version control, along with rigorous unit and system testing, underlines the robustness and reliability of the software. This project showcases my expertise in C programming, network communication, and software development best practices.</p>

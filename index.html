                     <p class="mt- 1">I believe there are two types of people. People who choose a career that comes easy to them, and people who find something challenging that they love and work hard to achieve in that field. I am the latter of the two, because I know I struggled so much to be where I am.<br><br>
                     I remember attending my first ever programming class thinking, "Do I even belong here?" Weeks go by with many late-night projects, only to do poorly on most. At this point, many people would be discouraged and possibly quit, but I know I did not get accepted into this major just to forfeit. I loved the feeling of fixing those segmentation faults which kept you up for hours. That feeling, which I know many can relate to, is what kept me going. I stayed resilient and recently graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a B.S. in Computer Science. I specialized in Systems and Software which dives deeply into Operating Systems.<br><br>
                     After completing my internship and a relatively long job search (9 months), I landed a position at Rivian Automotive as an Embedded Software Engineer. I currently work on the inverter project writing software that is related to safety. What happens when a vehicle crashes? What happens if the microcontroller stops beavhing as it should? What if the processor just resets randomly? With a team of experts, we help answer and execute these challenging questions.<br><br>
                     I am relatively early in my career, but with that, comes with motiviation and passion to continue learning new technologies. Currently, I am working on breaking into the Embedded Linux terrority by working on personal projects and expanding my knowledge on fundamentals such as the Kernel and Bootloader.<br><br></p>

I manually configured a linux image using buildroot to learn and understand Bootloader, Kernel, and file system configurations. I also created a TFTP server on a host Ubuntu machine to transfer files between the host and beaglebone. In the process the beaglbone booting up, it fetches the Linux image files from U-boot to boot into Linux. The linux image (zImage and .dtb are written into memory. I also wrote a extremely simple Linux kernel module and modified the build configuration files such as KConfig and Makefile to compile the module directly into the source.</p>

                     <p class="mt- 1">I believe there are two types of people. People who choose a career that comes easy to them, and people who find something challenging that they love and work hard to achieve in that field. I am the latter of the two, because I know I struggled so much to be where I am.<br><br>I remember attending my first ever programming class thinking, "Do I even belong here?" Weeks go by with many late-night projects, only to do poorly on most. At this point, many people would be discouraged and possibly quit, but I know I did not get accepted into this major just to forfeit. I loved the feeling of fixing those segmentation faults which kept you up for hours. That feeling, which I know many can relate to, is what kept me going. I stayed resilient and recently graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a B.S. in Computer Science. I specialized in Systems and Software which dives deeply into Operating Systems. My passion is to work with Embedded Software/Systems. However, because I am a new grad, I am open to new opportunities knowing that this is the perfect time to explore untouched areas of Software Engineering.<br><br>I understand hiring a new grad is risky for many companies. In fact it makes sense to hire someone with more experience who can get the job done, but if the rookies aren't given a chance, where are all the Senior Developers going to be in.. let's say 20 years? Not only am I looking for a company that excites me with the work they do, but also one that takes risks and has strong principals in helping others. Teamwork is extremely important in this field and it would be nice for a company to utilize creative ideas from their employees such as pair programming, where new grads like me can have a mentorship with experienced Software Engineers.<br><br>So what would I bring to the table? I am extremely hard working, motivated, and a curious learner who's waiting to be given a chance. My experience as a Quality Assurance Engineer has taught me not only about debugging, but also that creating clean software is not an easy job. I do not take well written code for granted, and try my best to do the same for every line of code I write. I still have so much to learn, and the best way to learn is through experience . If you have come this far, I am glad I grabbed your attention and thankful for your time. I hope my story depicts me as a potential candidate. If the company holds similar values and principals as I do, I urge you to get in touch and set up an interview.<br><br></p>
